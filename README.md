# Use Python to research  on  Optimized  Strategy  of  Power  Transmission via Battery Distribution or Power Grid.

This folder includes Zihan Zhang's internship experience with Associate Professor [ChenYing](http://www.eea.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/eea/1701/2010/20101220095500704964158/20101220095500704964158_.html), Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua  University from June 2019 to July 2019. 

The experience is meaningful and significant, since it was my first time to take charge a small project all by myself and wrote codes to solve academic problem. Basically, I implemented dynamic programming, Dijkstra algorithm,  Markov Decision Process, Lagrange Multiplier and Python Programming. I also crafted two papers to illustrate the results (in Chinese).
